# employee-summary-generator

This program allows you to enter various employees as either Engineers, Interns, or Managers and assign them each a name, id, email, and one unique attribute for each employee time (Engineer: github, Intern: school, Manager: office number), and then create an html file that shows each of the employees in their categories with their respective information.
